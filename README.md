👋 Hi there! I'm a Python developer with a strong background in finance, economics, and business processes. My journey in the world of coding has been shaped by my expertise in these fields, which allows me to bring a unique perspective to software development projects.

🛠️ I have experience working with a variety of Python frameworks and tools, including Django, Django Rest Framework (DRF), FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Flask, BeautifulSoup4, Scrapy, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. Whether it's building robust web applications or data scraping solutions, I thrive on turning ideas into code.

💼 My career has been marked by a commitment to delivering high-quality software that meets business objectives. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to optimize processes, drive efficiency, and create value.

🌐 Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of my projects and contributions. I'm always eager to collaborate and learn from fellow developers, so don't hesitate to reach out. Let's code, innovate, and make a difference together!
